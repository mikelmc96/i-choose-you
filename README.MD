# WDI Project 2- I Choose You

### Are you a Pokemon Fan?  Were you a kid who wanted a real-life Charmander more than a letter from Hogwarts?  Do you want to build competitive teams and battle your friends? 

## **Welcome, to I Choose You.**

I Choose You is a Pokemon Team-Building Application for your desktop or mobile device.  You will be given the chance to create and customize a trainer.  Give that trainer a multitude of teams to build and change.  And finally, the ability to add Pokemon to those teams, all the while changing their movesets and abilities at will.
